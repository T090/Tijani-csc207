<p><b><br>Things that happen to us in the beginning of our lives, during the childhood, very often have a great impact on our entire existence in this world. </br>
<br>And the best thing that can happen to a man in his early years is some kind of revelation that would show him what he is </br>
<br> he is supposed to do in his life. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that one of the most important aspects of our lives is our work,
 something to which we dedicate most of our time</br>
i also parrticipate in some of the extra cuiriculm activity in the secondary school then exampel are;<b>inter_school debate and going to excursion,and i am also in the debate club</b> 
<br> and to choose the right option from the very beginning is a very good fortune. In my opinion,
 one of the most difficult steps in every beginning is to actually choose what to do, and choose it correctly</br>
<br>I wasn’t so lucky and spent a good amount of time frantically rushing from one thing to another and trying to understand what is mine in this world,
 what I am best at. When at school, 
and i  am also aiming to write<b>a book that will be well known all over the world</b> this is one of the aim i have in the university</br> 
<br>Only after a long period of search I managed to understand that the thing I do best is translation and work with texts in general.</br>
<br>I have made a number of amateur translations of my favorite authors, tried out writing technical translations and so on.
 I found out that I am rather good at learning new languages:</p>
